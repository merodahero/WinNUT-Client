WinNUT is a WinForms client for connecting to a Network UPS Tools monitoring server.

- 📈 Monitor important values of your UPS like voltage and power consumption
- 🌩️ Receive notifications for abnormal power conditions (power outage)
- ❤️ Keep your hardware and data safe with configurable suspend and shutdown triggers

## Avalonia desktop preview

`WinNUT-Avalonia` is the current Windows desktop UI. It targets .NET 10 and is designed to keep all UPS readings honest: a NUT value is labelled as reported, a derived value shows its calculation, and unavailable readings are displayed as `—` rather than invented placeholders.

For end users, publish the app as a self-contained Windows executable; no .NET runtime is required:

```powershell
dotnet publish WinNUT_V2\WinNUT-Avalonia\WinNUT-Avalonia.csproj -c Release -p:PublishProfile=win-x64-self-contained
```

The executable is written to `WinNUT_V2\WinNUT-Avalonia\bin\Publish\win-x64\`. For development, use Visual Studio 2026 (18.0+) with the .NET desktop workload, or the .NET 10 SDK.

To produce the matching Windows x64 MSI, run:

```powershell
.\WinNUT_V2\Setup\build-avalonia-installer.ps1
```

The installer is written to `WinNUT_V2\Setup\bin\x64\Release\WinNUT-Avalonia.Setup.msi`. It installs the self-contained app under Program Files and adds a Start Menu shortcut. The legacy `Setup.vdproj` remains untouched for the original WinForms client.

# Future development
WinNUT has gone through a long evolution with several different programming languages and maintainers. The time has come to retire this iteration of WinNUT and begin planning for the next version. See [issue #40](https://github.com/nutdotnet/WinNUT-Client/issues/40) for more information. Join in the discussions at [Coco.Nut](https://github.com/nutdotnet/Coco.Nut), and shape the future of the next iteration of WinNUT.

# Installation
1. Get the [latest Release](https://github.com/nutdotnet/WinNUT-Client/releases)
2. Install WinNUT using the downloaded executable
3. If you were using an older version of WinNUT (v1.x), copy your "ups.ini" configuration file to the WinNUT-Client installation directory (by default "C:\Program Files(x86)\WinNUT-Client ") for an automatic import of your parameters during the first launch
4. Start WinNUT and modify the settings according to your needs

## Synology NAS 
If you are connecting to a Synology NAS with a UPS attached, there is some additional configuration that needs to be done.

Referring to the [Synology documentation](https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/system_hardware_ups?version=7), note that you must add your client computer's IP address to the *Permitted DiskStation Devices* window. In addition, WinNUT requires the following settings:

- **Login**: upsmon
- **Password**: secret
- **UPS Name**: ups


*See [issue 47](https://github.com/gawindx/WinNUT-Client/issues/47#issuecomment-759180793) for more information.*

## QNAP NAS 
If your NUT server is hosted on a QNAP NAS, be sure to provide the following connection information (default):

- **UPS Name**: qnapups
- (Login and Password can be empty)

Also check the "Enable network UPS master" box on the Control Panel -> External device page on the QNAP webinterface and add the IP address of the WinNUT-Client to allow the client to connect to the QNAP for UPS information.

# Updates

WinNUT has built-in update functionality. This process can be started automatically on startup or manually on demand, and you can choose whether you want to update to the stable or development version. During this process, the new files will be automatically downloaded and installed.
